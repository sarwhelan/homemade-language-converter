# homemade-language-converter

This simple Python script converts normal english sentences into a non-official language that my mom & I created when I was young.
Typing "our" language in a text convo is super annoying because it takes forever, so I created this to make it way easier and faster!
Feel free to test it out. Just run the script via command line.
